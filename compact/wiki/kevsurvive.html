<p There also are a bunch other stuff, not just custom enchantments></p>
<p><u>Currency</u></p>
<p>Currently the only use for <i>KCOINS <sup class="lt">(currency)</sup></i> is some items in the shop. Other than the Wood and ores, KCOINS are basically a collectible item you get from mining ores and killing mobs. Maybe in the future KCOINS will have a use.<sup class="lt">[2/10/2021 9PM]</sup></p>
<p><u>How to play Kevcore SMP</u></p>
<p>Kevcore SMP is well, a SMP <sup class="lt">(Survival)</sup>. No hacking or griefing, KCSMP is mostly a creation server. Bulid structures, houses, <i>towns</i>, and other stuff. KCSMP also has some minigames, such as sumo and a parkour. There are also custom commands, and by using the command <b>/trigger help</b>, you can see some custom commands you can use. /trigger help is not up-to-date, so you may find some commands that aren't in the /trigger help.<sup class="lt">[2/10/2021 9PM]</sup></p>
<p><u>Secrets</u></p>
<p>There are lots of secrets. Some secrets come from commands. Some come from structures. Some are even items!</p>
<p>After the "No cheats, update", illegal items such as bedrock, command blocks, and barriers were removed. This is because before when there were town events, some illegal items like illegal enchantments were given. Now, they are removed from everyone, but you may find some illegal items still in chests.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the world has a chest of a OP diamond sword, having a sharpness 20. There is no exact location, but it is in a place near spawn<sup class="lt">[2/16/2021 1PM]</sup></p>
<p><u>Storyline</u></p>
<p>If you don't know, Kevcore SMP was the second server to be made. Back then, there was a server called <i>Kevcore Survival</i>, a server similar to our Kevcore SMP today. But after Kevcore Survival experienced a huge corruption with no backups, the main sever was switched to KevSurvive. Kevcore SMP was created in hardcore mode, with no command blocks. Just vanilla. After a while, events started to happen. This is when hardcore mode was turned off. After town events are over, functions (datapacks) are created, replacing command blocks. If you were playing back then, you will know how annoying the new <i>idlekick</i> was. Town ranks are replaced by normal ranks (MVP, VIP), and Kevcore SMP became fun. KCoins had a use back then, which is the <b>/trigger towntp</b> command. It no longer exists today, as now we have <b>/trigger tpa</b>. Using /trigger towntp, you can easily travel back to your home town. Some people reported this as a easy TP cheat, so /trigger tpa was made.<sup class="lt">[2/16/2021 8PM]</sup></p>
