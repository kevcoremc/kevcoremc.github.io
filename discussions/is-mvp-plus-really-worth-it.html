<h2>Is MVP+ really worth it?</h2>
<sup>By Kevcore25</sup>
<hr>
<p>Recently there is a new rank called MVP+. This rank is hard to get as you need to get MVP first. But you might think that there is no point as it has all the same features as MVP.</p>
<p>Well, no. MVP+ can test all the new things that might be added to the future. They can also get commands that are actually useful. For example, there is a new /trigger stats set -2 which can only be used by MVP's to get around 20 KCoin bags per second, but an even faster way is /trigger stats set -3, only for MVP+'s. This will give around 100 KCoin bags per second, enough to almost give you all your KCoin bags instantly! </p>
<p>But the question still isn't answered-is MVP+ worth it?</p>
<p>I would say MVP+ isn't worth it, unless you do chat and use bots on my server on a daily basis. MVP+ is really hard to get, as you can only store 1000 KC Coins in your bank, and you also need 9000 in your wallet. Having this is a super high risk of getting robbed, which resets your progress. This goes the same with MVP, although it is much easier to get</p>
<p>I would recommend MVP instead, as it has&nbsp;<i>almost</i>&nbsp;the same features. You should also get VIP if your not looking to chat everyday. VIP isn't much of a difference, but it does give extra /trigger stats stats</p>
