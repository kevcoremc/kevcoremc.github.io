<p class="t">Hello! I used to create a server using Aternos, a free minecraft server hosting, but I found out hosting my own using the official Minecraft page was much faster. I use about 3GB of RAM for my servers.</p>
<p class="t"><u>What is an KCSMP server?</u></p>
<p class="t">A KCSMP server is a vanilla server with command blocks to make the game more enjoyable.</p>
<p class="t">A KCSMP server has to:</p>
<p class="t">1. Be a vanilla server (No spigot, forge, etc)</p>
<p class="t">2. Have custom commands using /trigger</p>
<p class="t">3. Not just survival&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="t">The server opens from 9AM - 9PM</strong></p>

<p>Kevcore SMP was the second server to be made, and is still running to this day. Kevcore SMP is also known as&nbsp;<em>KevSurvive</em>&nbsp;or KCSMP.</p>
<p>KCSMP is the original server to be played on. It has a variety of fun stuff made using commands, such as custom enchantments, currency, and more all made using commands in Vanilla minecraft. There is also a datapack you can download and put into your world (<em>download in the&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RT-TiEb9etOOlh0Pq2cEcyswM-zO7fhk?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">google drive</a>&nbsp;folder</em>).<sup class="lt">[2/10/2021 10PM]</sup></p>

<p><u>Custom Enchantments</u></p>
<p>There are some Custom Enchantments. All Custom Enchantments have a Pros and Cons.</p>

<p><u>Currency</u></p>
<p>Currently the only use for&nbsp;<em>KCOINS&nbsp;<sup class="lt">(currency)</sup></em>&nbsp;is some items in the shop. Other than the Wood and ores, KCOINS are basically a collectible item you get from mining ores and killing mobs. Maybe in the future KCOINS will have a use.<sup class="lt">[2/10/2021 9PM]</sup></p>
<p><u>How to play Kevcore SMP</u></p>
<p>Kevcore SMP is well, a SMP&nbsp;<sup class="lt">(Survival)</sup>. No hacking or griefing, KCSMP is mostly a creation server. Bulid structures, houses,&nbsp;<em>towns</em>, and other stuff. KCSMP also has some minigames, such as sumo and a parkour. There are also custom commands, and by using the command&nbsp;<strong>/trigger help</strong>, you can see some custom commands you can use. /trigger help is not up-to-date, so you may find some commands that aren't in the /trigger help.<sup class="lt">[2/10/2021 9PM]</sup></p>
<p><u>Secrets</u></p>
<p>There are lots of secrets. Some secrets come from commands. Some come from structures. Some are even items!</p>
<p>After the "No cheats, update", illegal items such as bedrock, command blocks, and barriers were removed. This is because before when there were town events, some illegal items like illegal enchantments were given. Now, they are removed from everyone, but you may find some illegal items still in chests.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the world has a chest of a OP diamond sword, having a sharpness 20. There is no exact location, but it is in a place near spawn<sup class="lt">[2/16/2021 1PM]</sup></p>
<p><u>Storyline</u></p>
<p>If you don't know, Kevcore SMP was the second server to be made. Back then, there was a server called&nbsp;<em>Kevcore Survival</em>, a server similar to our Kevcore SMP today. But after Kevcore Survival experienced a huge corruption with no backups, the main sever was switched to KevSurvive. Kevcore SMP was created in hardcore mode, with no command blocks. Just vanilla. After a while, events started to happen. This is when hardcore mode was turned off. After town events are over, functions (datapacks) are created, replacing command blocks. If you were playing back then, you will know how annoying the new&nbsp;<em>idlekick</em>&nbsp;was. Town ranks are replaced by normal ranks (MVP, VIP), and Kevcore SMP became fun. KCoins had a use back then, which is the&nbsp;<strong>/trigger towntp</strong>&nbsp;command. It no longer exists today, as now we have&nbsp;<strong>/trigger tpa</strong>. Using /trigger towntp, you can easily travel back to your home town. Some people reported this as a easy TP cheat, so /trigger tpa was made.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ERRORS</strong></span></p>
<p><u><strong>Why did I get an error from the server?</strong></u></p>
<p>Some reasons are that there are some problems with the server. Here is a list of the most common errors:</p>
<p>&shy;</p>

<p><strong>Error 101:</strong>&nbsp;A command line is missing or not working properly</p>
<p><strong>Error 102:</strong>&nbsp;The server is down or has low TPS (ticks per second)</p>
<p><strong>Error 103:</strong>&nbsp;The command could not ban you either by the command not meeting the op permission level, coding failure, or Error 102</p>
<p><strong>Error 104:</strong>&nbsp;The command could not kick you either by the command not meeting the op permission level, coding failure, or Error 102</p>
<p><strong>Error 105:</strong>&nbsp;The command could not disconnect you either by the command not meeting the op permission level, coding failure, or Error 102</p>
<p><strong>Error 106:</strong>&nbsp;<em>undefined</em></p>
<p><strong>Error 107:</strong>&nbsp;Can not get server TPS&nbsp;<em>(the /trigger tps was removed)</em></p>
