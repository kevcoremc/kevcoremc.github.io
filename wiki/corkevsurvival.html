<p>Kevcore Survival is a private server. It is the first ever server Kevcore made. It was a fun server, and it is survival. Many people joined the server those days. But due to a corruption, the server is gone. The main server was transferred to Kevsurvive (KevcoreSMP)
</p>
<p>­</p>
<p><u>How Kevcore Survival died</u></p>
<p>Due to a corruption, the server died. Everything was lost, and with no backups to be used, the server got deleted. This time also lost some players. How the corruption happened is unknown, but it probably had to deal with the computer hosting the server. It might've had a power issue, and shutted down. How this is known is because recently <i>KevcoreSMP</i> had a corruption. There was backups to support it, though, and the server was re-rolled 1 week back. Not too much of a difference for other people, but a huge difference for Kevcore. The cause of this is a immediate shutdown. Based on that story, we can assume that Kevcore Survival had the same issue.</p>
